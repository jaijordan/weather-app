## Weather App
A basic weather app that I created using Javascript

## API Used
- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- The weather provided by Open Weather Map isn't 100% accurate. I believe this is a limitation of using the free version of the API.   
  As such if you wish to wish to get more accurate data, I suggest using a paid version of the API.
  
## How to Run?

Clone the repository and insert your own API Key(can be received from Open Weather Map) into the key variable in index.js file.  
Then simply open the html file in your browser and you're done.
